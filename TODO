# TODO

## PRIORITIES

- refactor site to Angular App
- fix dog log
  - each log entry needs to be changed, box shapes suck, remove boxes maybe
  - buttons for each activity type with tooltip (no actual text)
  - form should just be emoji buttons, no time/date/comment/+, just buttons
  - log entries are the same, no text just emoji with tooltip
  - add a edit button as well as the delete button to the entries
  - after a week has passed, the entries delete themselves
- make potato's birthday change to be accurate(change birthday on refresh)
- make pictures easy to upload
- change login to be a 4 digit pin, prompt with number pad for input
- admin login for specific things like uploading photos
- timeline change to a gallery scroll that also has pictures/animations of Potato

## SECONDARY

- reorganize gallery look
- Progressive Web App
- When scrolling down nav bar disappears and when scrolling up it appears
- change font of "my name is potato" to:
- page scrolling animation (like flipping through book but up to down)

## FUTURE PLANS

- Another page for instructions
- Add a button on the dog log for people to send their dog logs to an email.
