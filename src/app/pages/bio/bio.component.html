        When I was 8 weeks old, my mommy got me from a puppy
        mill in Missouri. I used to be brown and black so she
        named me Potato but now I'm white so joke's on her.

            I eat Farmer's Dog fresh food like a queen. It is tailored to me
            because I am a picky eater. I also only eats
            jerky treats so none of that yucky biscuit crap.

            I pee about every 7 to 8 hours and poop 1 to 2
            times a day.

            for that.

        <h3>Here are some fun facts about me:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I love them meats like bacon and chicken, but
            make sure there is nothing on them and I don't
            eat too much or I'll throw up and you'll have a
            mess to clean up. I won't eat any of my fruits
            or vegetables and that makes my mommy sad. If
            you give me carrots, I'll chew them up and
            scatter them around the house for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            My best friend's name is Toby. He is HUGE but we
            have fun. I also love other dogs but they don't
            like me that much.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't freak out if you notice I don't have
            two of my front teeth. I lost them in a fight
            with a slipper.
